# Hi. I'm Areeb and I am a newbie competitive programmer
I'm going to be tracking my codeforces submissions on here. I am very very new to competitive programming and started when I, very embarassingly couldn't even begin to solve an assessment algorithm problem at my internship. This made me realise that I, as an aspiring developer and new-found computer science enthusiast, need to address this immediately. So, I've turned to codeforces to both improve my problem solving skills and also improve my python shorthand (which is, as of July 2025, awful).

I'll be sharing my solutions to problems I'll be solving from here on out over here on this github repo. I'll be solving the easiest and most commonly solved problems for a while. It's fun and has improved my familiarity with python's standard library immensely, which I believe is a fundamental skill all developers should have. Despite being a rising computer science senior at my university, I've always felt incompetent and greatly unlearned; only passing my courses and never feeling like I could ever build anything on my own or write code to solve real world problems. This repo will be a simple documentation of a part of this journey of mine in building my confidence to be a competent and well-educated and studied developer. Let's see where this journey takes me.
